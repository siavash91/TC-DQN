## Abstract

<div align="justify"> In this work, we study adaptive data-guided traffic planning and control using Reinforcement Learning. We shift from the plain use of classic methods towards state-of-the-art in deep RL community. We embed several recent techniques in our algorithm that improve the original DQN for discrete control and discuss the traffic-related interpretations that follow. We propose a novel DQN-based algorithm for Traffic Control (called TC-DQN+) as a tool for fast and more reliable traffic decision-making. We introduce a new form of reward function which is further discussed using illustrative examples with comparisons to traditional traffic control methods. </div> <br>
